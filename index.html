        <p>Isaac Onyach is a first year software development student at KCA university. Onyach was born in the begninning of the 1990s
          but unlike his peers, has almost spent his entire life in and out of schooling institutions. He enrolled to study a Bsc. Electrical
          and Electronics Engineering at Kenyatta University but he dropped out after spending a significant amount of time and wasting lots of
          resources. He is currently trying to salvage what's left of his life by studying a very expensive Bsc. Software Development</p>

      <td>
        <p>I dove into freelance academic writing after dropping out of college whereby I helped hundreds of students in developed countries with their assignments
          although it might not be apparent, I helped hundreds of students get good grades and in the process, I got to know a lot about different facets of life and education.
          I believe this has made me an overall wellrounded person</p>
